Code final version 1.0 I rebuilded this repository again because of my crooked hands

so there is no available differencies while working on the project

Shortly about files:

Start.py - main file that switch on the programm;

pams.py - file with initial matrix data that r used in program;

mainmotion.py - file acting with user and chooses switches dependently on user inputing;

functions.py - file with functions obviously.
